                   <h3>Greetings! My name is Stacey- the "S" in SNAP of Iowa Photography.</h3>
                            <p>I have a love for capturing authentic moments and rooting them forever in the present as
                            photographs. I believe that families and the people within grow and change in what seems like the
                            blink of an eye. That documenting who and where we are in our lives is important. I strive to give
                            you timeless images that you'll sit down and show your grandchildren some day. Images that you'll
                            look reminiscently at in 20 years, see your face wide with laughter and remember where you were in
                            your life.
                        </p>
